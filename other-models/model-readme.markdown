About Model `images.ive`
========================

This model was quickly thrown together by Ryan Pavlik using Google SketchUp (original file included) and exported using the [Sketchup to OSG Exporter][sketchup2osg] plugin. Its sole purpose was to put textured quads ("images") into the environment working around a now-fixed issue experienced with VR JuggLua (actually a defect lower in the stack).

Images in the model include the logo (created by Ryan Pavlik) and a diagram built by Ryan Pavlik from photos he took.
