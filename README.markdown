Virtual METaL
=============

This is an application built with [VR JuggLua][vrjlua] that provides for virtual exploration of the [METaL virtual reality system][metal] at the [Iowa State University Virtual Reality Applications Center][vrac].

Instructions
------------
Load `main.lua` in NavTestbed to begin.

As a basic "NavTestbed" application, button 0 (A on the Wiimote) will navigate in the direction you point. Button 1 (B aka trigger on the Wiimote) will allow you to "draw" on the model with spheres.
